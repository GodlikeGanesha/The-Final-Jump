To Compile Lib:
fbc -lib ploadlib.bas

Intention of Use:
  ploadlib is intended for use with FreeBASIC
  programs in order to load PNG Image files with
  a one function step manner. The library is
  quick, reliable, and has little overhead.

Supports:
  -Both Interlaced and NonInterlaced PNGs
  -Bit depths [per sample]: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
  -Color Types: Grayscale, RGB, Paletted
  -Alpha Channel* [Partial Transparency]
  -tRNS Chunk* [One color/Paletted Transparency]
  -gAMA

  *Note: You must PUT with ALPHA to view these correctly.

  In paletted screen modes, ploadlib only supports paletted
  and grayscale images, and does not support transparency.
  
  ploadlib will change the screen's palette so that the
  loaded image will display correctly.  You can disable this
  in ploadlib.bas at compile time by defining UpdatePalette
  as 0 instead of -1.

  Pload
  ------

  Description:
    Loads a PNG from a file

  Syntax:
          pload ( Filename )

  Arguments:
    Filename - A String specifying the PNG file to load

  Returns:
    An FB Image buffer pointer, 0 if error

  Example:

      Screen 19, 32
      #include "ploadlib.bi"

      Dim As Any Ptr Image

      Image = Pload( "alphatest.png" )

      Put (0,0), Image, ALPHA

      ImageDestroy(Image)

      Sleep
      System

  ==---==-==---===
  MPload
  ------

  Description:
    Loads a PNG from a buffer pointer

  Syntax:
          mpload ( Buffer, Length )

  Arguments:
    Buffer - A pointer to a valid PNG Buffer
    Length - The Length of the Buffer

  Returns:
    An FB Image buffer pointer, 0 if error

  Example:
    See example.bas

  ==---==-==---===
  Pload_GetError
  ------

  Description:
    Returns specific error code

  Syntax:
          Pload_GetError ( )

  Arguments:

  Returns:
    A pload error code (PLOAD_ERR type), PLOAD_NOERROR is returned by default

  Example:

      Screen 19, 32
      #include "ploadlib.bi"

      Dim As Any Ptr Image
      Dim As PLOAD_ERR ErrorCode

      Image = Pload( "alphatest.png" )

      ErrorCode = Pload_GetError()
      
      If ErrorCode = PLOAD_NOERROR Then
         Put (0,0), Image, ALPHA
      Else
         Print ErrorCode
      End If

      ImageDestroy(Image)

      Sleep
      System

  Appendix A: Pload Error Codes
  ------
    Possible Returns from Pload_GetError:

      PLOAD_NOERROR            'No Error
      PLOAD_INVALIDSIG         '7 byte Signature Check Failed
      PLOAD_FILECORRUPTED      'Cyclic Redundancy Check Failed
      PLOAD_INVALIDCHUNKS      'Chunks could be in improper order, invalid sigs, critical chunks not recognized, missing required critical chunks
      PLOAD_INVALIDHEADER      'IDHR chunk unsupported according to specification
      PLOAD_INVALID_IDATSTREAM 'Most likely the IDAT stream [zstream] is corrupt and zlib spit back an error
      PLOAD_RENDERINGFAILED    'Current Screendepth is not 24 or 32, ImageCreate Failed, or PLTE chunk is invalid
      PLOAD_FILEOPENED_FAILED  'PLOAD() Failed when opening file
      PLOAD_MISCERROR          'Error trapped by ON ERROR (Must have ON ERROR checking enabled, see source)
